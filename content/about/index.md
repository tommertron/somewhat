## The Somewhat Story

It was a cold winter night in Winnipeg in 2023â€¦ No, seriously, it was.

**Kris Bruun** (Class of â€™01), **Kate Hodgert-Fennell** (Class of â€™03), and **Isabelle Ly** (Class of â€™06) were catching up over a couple of drinks when someone made a half-hearted quip about getting the old gang back together. Wouldnâ€™t that be fun?

But small ideas are never small for go-get-â€™em theatre kids.

Not one to sit back and weather a brainstorm without action, **Kate** dove in. She poured her time, energy, and love into igniting a burst of creativity. Before long, something real began to crystallize.

Soon, a new group of recruits snowballed into the mix: **Felicity (Alexander) Barons** (Class of â€™03/â€™04), **Eleri Evans** (Class of â€™02), **Peter Higgins** (Class of â€™03), **Sarah (Bustard) Lazzarino** (Class of â€™04), **Stacey Norton** (Class of â€™06), **Shari Porter** (Class of â€™05), and **Tom Robertson** (Class of â€™02).

This ragtag crew took on a mountain of workâ€”navigating policies, red tape, and logisticsâ€”to turn a little snowflake of an idea into a full-blown reunion for the early-2000s Queenâ€™s Drama, **QMT**, and **Queenâ€™s Players** crowd. At the core was a simple belief: the early-2000s Queenâ€™s Drama folks are good people, and getting together to party with them would be a good time. Nay, a fantastic time.

## What a Weekend: The Somewhat Reunion (May 2025)

And it was.

Across a magical few days, we laughed, sang, told stories, and fell right back into that old rhythm of creative mischief. It went beyond lanyards, meal options, and even fireworks (though those helped). Mostly, it was the peopleâ€”creative, kind, accepting misfits who once filled black boxes and lecture halls with big ideas and bigger feelings.

Night one set the tone: a packed house at the Mansion with Queenâ€™s alum band **The Lustre** bringing the noise, followed by a late-night pilgrimage to **Bubbaâ€™s**. Back in res, it felt like the first day of school all over againâ€”friends catching up, swapping stories, and staying up far too late.

We heard it over and over: the weekend felt **special**. Not just for nostalgiaâ€™s sake, but for the feeling of being surrounded by creative folks againâ€”brought together not for profit or glory, but for **community, creativity, and fun**.

Together we also raised **$5,000** for **Queenâ€™s Musical Theatre (QMT)**â€”a tangible way to pay it forward to the next wave of makers.

We were thrilled to have the support of beloved profs **Tim Fort** and **Adair Redish**. **Timâ€™s** speech at dinner brought the house down, and **Tom Robertson** (Class of â€™02) emceed the evening with warmth and wit. **Andrew Johnston** (Class of â€™04) kept the energy going with an unforgettable karaoke night. **Graeme Stewart** (Class of â€™02) helped ensure we remembered friends who are no longer with us.

Thank youâ€”to everyone who traveled, sang, danced, shouted Oil Thigh, hugged, cried, and closed down the bar (or two). You made the Somewhat Reunion the kind of weekend weâ€™ll be telling stories about for years.

## Tim Fort, Emeritus Professor, Dan School for Drama and Music

> As an Emeritus Professor of the Dan School for Drama and Music (and the Head of Drama during the time covered by this reunion: 2000-2005) I was overwhelmed by the amount of energy and thought put into this event and, most particularly, by the huge response it generated. Honestly, over the course of my 30-plus years as a faculty member at Queen’s, it was rare for our unit to get more than a handful of returning Drama alumni during any of the regularly scheduled homecoming events. This event was different. At the heart of its success was its totally personable and fully alumni-generated nature. The scope and inclusiveness of this non-traditional get together resulted in a weekend of activities that not only awakened a sort of “team spirit” within a full era of Queen’s Drama grads but also resulted in a $5,000 class donation to Queen’s Musical Theatre.

> In every way, it is clear events like the “Somewhat Reunion” are both a model and a reminder of the powerful lifelong communities that Queen’s can inspire.

## Saif Andani, Vice President, Alumni Relations & Outreach Coordinator, Queen's Musical Theatre 
>The Somewhat Reunion initiative has meaningfully transformed how our alumni engage with the Queen’s Musical Theatre community. Over the past few decades, we’ve seen former members return to campus for our alumni galas, fill our audiences with familiar faces cheering on new casts and crews, reconnect with old castmates, and form supportive mentorship ties with current students.

> This renewed presence has strengthened the intergenerational nature of our club and has reinforced the idea that involvement at Queen’s continues long after graduation. Earlier this year, the Somewhat Reunion initiative raised $5,000 in support of our 2025-26 production season, a contribution made possible through the engagement and sense of belonging fostered by this lovely group. This support has enhanced our ability to produce high-quality, student-led theatre and created more opportunities for our members to grow as artists, collaborators, and leaders.


## Sheanna Beau-James, class of '05

> The weekend was a trust fall back in time- landing in the arms of peers with whom I had build bonds born of creativity, artistic explorations, and shared experience in my late teenage and early adult years. I knew I was looking forward to coming to the Somewhat Reunion, but I couldn't have guessed what a sense of unspoken support and encouragement I would feel reconnecting with friends who knew me as I was exploring what it meant to be myself, and in so doing was able to literally re-member parts of myself that I have ignored or neglected in the race to grow up and succeed.

## Dan Dumsha, class of '03

> The Reunion was an absolute highlight of my year and a powerful testament to the enduring bonds forged during our time in Kingston.
>
> This was more than just a trip; it was a deeply meaningful journey back to the foundation of where I grew up, both personally and professionally. Seeing colleagues and friends after two decades immediately reconnected me to the vibrant spirit of Queen's and the unique community the Drama Department fostered.
>
> The event successfully reignited my commitment to the university, making me feel more connected to Queen's today than I have in years.

## Stephen Sheffer, class of '02

> Queen's Drama is a formative part of who I am today. The Somewhat Reunion initiative has kept the connection with my cohort strong.

## Tiffany Clayton Gillespie, class of '03

> The committee created an event that revitalized my connection to Queen's and the Queen's community. It allowed us to celebrate all of the amazing parts of our experience, and it acknowledged the challenges we overcame individually and together. It gave me newfound love and respect for the 20-something version of myself. That sense of confidence and self-appreciation has carried back with me beyond the reunion and has added so much love back into my life.

## Aaron Guravich, class of '04

> The Somewhat Reunion is the only reunion event I've attended. It was superbly planned and executed and it meant so very much to me to see so many dear friends from my undergraduate days in one place. I'm deeply grateful to the planning committee for their hard work and dedication.

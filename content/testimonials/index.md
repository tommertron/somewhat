## Sheanna Beau-James, class of '05

This past weekend was a trust fall back in time- landing in the arms of peers with whom I had build bonds born of creativity, artistic explorations, and shared experience in my late teenage and early adult years. I knew I was looking forward to coming to the Somewhat Reunion, but I couldn't have guessed what a sense of unspoken support and encouragement I would feel reconnecting with friends who knew me as I was exploring what it meant to be myself, and in so doing was able to literally re-member parts of myself that I have ignored or neglected in the race to grow up and succeed.

## Dan Dumsha, class of '03

"The Queen's Drama 20-Year Reunion was an absolute highlight of my year and a powerful testament to the enduring bonds forged during our time in Kingston.

This was more than just a trip; it was a deeply meaningful journey back to the foundation of where I grew up, both personally and professionally. Seeing colleagues and friends after two decades immediately reconnected me to the vibrant spirit of Queen's and the unique community the Drama Department fostered.

The event successfully reignited my commitment to the university, making me feel more connected to Queen's today than I have in years. For its incredible emotional resonance, its ability to bridge 20 years of history, and its success in re-engaging alumni, this reunion is truly deserving of the Alumni Event of the Year Award."

## Stephen Sheffer, class of '02

"Queen's Drama is a formative part of who I am today. The Somewhat Reunion initiative has kept the connection with my cohort strong."

## Tiffany Clayton Gillespie, class of '03

This committee created an event that revitalized my connection to Queen's and the Queen's community. It allowed us to celebrate all of the amazing parts of our experience, and it acknowledged the challenges we overcame individually and together. It gave me newfound love and respect for the 20-something version of myself. That sense of confidence and self-appreciation has carried back with me beyond the reunion and has added so much love back into my life.

## Aaron Guravich, class of '04

The Somewhat Reunion is the only reunion event I've attended. It was superbly planned and executed and it meant so very much to me to see so many dear friends from my undergraduate days in one place. I'm deeply grateful to the planning committee for their hard work and dedication.
